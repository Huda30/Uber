# *Project overview*ðŸš—ðŸš˜




Uber Technologies, Inc., commonly referred to as Uber, is an American multinational transportation company that offers ride-hailing services, courier services, food delivery, and freight transport. The company is headquartered in San Francisco, California, and operates in approximately 70 countries and 10,500 cities worldwide.

I've used Python and completed this project to showcase and boost my data analyst applications. Data pre-processing/data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), extract, transform and load pipeline (ETL) have been completed.

Along with that, there are challenges which have been solved based on my tech skills and showcasing the following challenge:

- The maximum number of monthly pickups in New York City.
- The hourly rush on weekdays.
- The locations in NYC with the highest rush during rush hour and the most active vehicles using Folium base-map.
- Pair-wise analysis to examine traffic rush on weekdays.
- Data automation in a defined data function using a styled pivot table.
