Who doesn’t like Uber? Rain or shine they are always on time! ✨🌧️ 👍🏾

I've completed this project to showcase and boost my data analyst applications. Data pre-processing/data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), extract, transform and load pipeline (ETL) have been completed.

Built data visualization of this business using Python, saving me a week of manual work for the project. ✔💯

There are also challenges that I have addressed using my technical skills, demonstrated by the following challenge:🎯

- The maximum number of monthly pickups in New York City.
- The hourly rush on weekdays.
- The locations in NYC with the highest rush during rush hour and the most active vehicles using Folium base-map.
- Pair-wise analysis to examine traffic rush on weekdays.
- Data automation in a defined data function using a styled pivot table.
